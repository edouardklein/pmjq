PMJQ
#######################################

PMJQ is a daemon that watches one or more directories for new files, process them using a user-provided command, and dumps the results in one or more other directories.

Chaining multiple instances allows one to build a whole data processing flowchart made up of individual commands.

Sharing the filesystem between mutliple machines allows one to share the load transparently.

The daemon is written in Go and can be statically compiled.

The supporting tools are written in Python.

A more complete documentation has yet to be written.


***************
Installation from sources
***************

The only hard dependency for building the package is the  `Go programming language <https://golang.org/doc/install>`. Optional dependencies include:

* `lnav <http://lnav.org/>`
* `sshfs <https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs>`
* `golint <https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/lint/golint>`
* Python 3

Clone the repo and run ``make install`` in it. To only install the tool and none of its supporting components, run ``go install`` instead.
