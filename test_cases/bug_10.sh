#
# One solution is to forbid the locking of non existant files
# If the locker does not check if a file exist before it gives it to the spawner,
# sometimes we have a bad time (we open a file that does not exist anymore)
# The bug does not appear when the number is small (~ 100)
# It randomly appears when the number is around 2500
# It appears every time with 10 000 files
